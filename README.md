# PropertiesPracticing
In this repository I have practiced how to work with properties files like .properties, .xml files to receive key-value pairs

Here you can see how to receive properties from properties files using load() and how to use them in your application.
Also you can see common methods of Properties class like remove(), put(), replace(), store(), list(), keys(), elements(), size().
Here I also implemented PropertiesConvertor that converts .xml properties to default .properties extension with some modification of properties list.
